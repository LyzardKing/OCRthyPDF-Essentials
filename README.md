# OCRthyPDF-Essentials
Make your PDF files text-searchable (A GUI for OCRmyPDF)

This is a basic user interface for the command line tool OCRmyPDF. 

It's main purpose is to provide users that are not used to command line tools access to OCRmyPDF's basic features.

You can use it to make PDF files that contain images with text (e. g. after scanning) searchable by adding an invisible text layer.

If you like the results created with OCRthyPDf but need more flexibility or more languages  I suggest you give OCRmyPDF a try on the command line. :)

# How To Install

If you are using Ubuntu you can install it directly from the Snap Store or you can type

<code>sudo snap install ocrthypdf</code> 

in your terminal.
