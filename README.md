# OCRthyPDF-Essentials
Make your PDF files text-searchable (A GUI for OCRmyPDF)

This is a basic user interface for the command line tool OCRmyPDF. 

It's main purpose is to provide users that are not used to command line tools easy access to OCRmyPDF's basic features.  

You can use it to make PDF files that contain images with text (e. g. after scanning) searchable by adding an invisible text layer.

Currently supported languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Finnish, Dutch

If you like the results created with OCRthyPDf but need more flexibility or more languages  I suggest you give OCRmyPDF a try on the command line. :)
