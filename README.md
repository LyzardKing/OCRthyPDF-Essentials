# OCRthyPDF-Essentials
Make your PDF files text-searchable (A GUI for [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF/))

This is a user interface for the command line tool [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF/). 

It's main purpose is to provide users that are not used to command line tools access to OCRmyPDF's basic features.

You can use it to make PDF files that contain images with text (e. g. after scanning) searchable by adding an invisible text layer.

If you like the results created with OCRthyPDF but need more flexibility I suggest you give [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF/) a try on the command line. :)
